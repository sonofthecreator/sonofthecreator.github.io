<h4> SELF DISCOVERY</h4>
                            <p>“Self Discovery” is an artwork that takes you on a journey of creative exploration and personal growth. It’s like looking into a mirror, where you can connect with your own emotions and experiences.
                                <br>
                                Imagine starting with a blank canvas, just like a fresh start in life. As you paint, different colors and shapes emerge, representing the different sides of who you are and the paths you can take to discover yourself.

<h4>See For Me</h4>
                            <p>SEE FOR ME…”SEE FOR ME”: “In the depths of our emotions, where the heart beats with both vulnerability and strength, the eyes become storytellers, whispering tales of joy, sorrow, and everything in between. As the words delicately etched on the paper, they give voice to these unspoken feelings, revealing the raw essence of the human experience. Each stroke of my brush is a dance, guided by the symphony of emotions conveyed through the writings. With every brushstroke, I strive to capture the profound meaning behind every gaze, every glance, and every tear that falls                                .</p>

                            <h4>ARE MEN ALLOWED TO CRY</h4>
                            <p>“ARE MEN ALLOWED TO CRY?! “ “Are men allowed to cry?!” is a thought-provoking artwork that delves into the societal pressures and expectations placed on men when it comes to expressing their emotions. The piece captures the struggle and vulnerability that men may face when they are seen shedding tears. It serves as a powerful commentary on the notion that men are often expected to be strong and stoic, suppressing their emotions in order to conform to traditional gender roles. This artwork aims to create a relatable experience for men, highlighting the importance of breaking free from societal norms and embracing the full range of human emotions. It encourages a more inclusive and empathetic society where men feel comfortable expressing their feelings without judgment or stigma.</p>
                            
 <h4>EYES UPON US</h4>
                            <p>“Eyes Upon Us” is a captivating piece that explores the theme of constant observation and scrutiny in our modern society. The artwork features a powerful image of someone carrying a TV with an eye looking out of it, symbolizing the pervasive surveillance and lack of privacy we experience in our daily lives. It serves as a reminder of the ever-watchful eyes that are upon us.
                                <br>
                                Through this artwork, I invite viewers to reflect on the impact of this constant observation and the pressure to conform to societal expectations. It prompts us to question the balance between sharing our lives and maintaining our personal boundaries. The artwork encourages us to find our own voice and embrace our individuality, even in the face of judgment.

                            <p>THROUGH HER SHATTERED EYE 
                                She was just a child,
                                Her laughter still fresh,
                                Her hands still innocent,
                                The world was hers to explore—
                                Until they stole it all away.
                                <br>
                                Now, fear curls in her chest,
                                Like smoke suffocating her dreams,
                                Her steps are softer, slower, smaller,
                                Because outside is not safe anymore,
                                Not for her, not for girls like her.

 <h4>Tactical Version</h4>
                            <p>“Tactile Vision” highlights the deep connection between touch and sight, urging us to reconsider how we perceive the world around us. In daily life, we often separate these senses—seeing something from afar, touching it up close—but this artwork challenges that division. The eyes embedded in the palms symbolize how our hands, through touch, can perceive in ways our eyes alone cannot. This reflects the idea that true understanding of the world often comes not just from seeing but from physically engaging with it.
