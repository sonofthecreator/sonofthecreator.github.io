                        <div class="stars">
                            This piece turns a simple plastic bag into a powerful statement about permanence and consequence. Plastic, a material that can outlive entire generations, stands as a symbol of both human creativity and the lasting scars we leave on the environment. Its quiet, haunting presence forces us to face the truth of what we leave behind. <br> 
                            More than just an object, this bag holds tension between the disposable and the enduring. Like Maurizio Cattelan’s banana, it transforms the everyday into a critique of value, waste, and legacy. This is more than art—it’s a reflection of our times, and its message will only grow louder as the years go by.

                            I have seen things I cannot unsee. I have felt the weight of being both an observer and a creator, of knowing that every expression is a risk. Between Vision and Voice is not just an art piece. It is my reality painted into form. The eye within the lips is the tension I live with, the balance between perception and expression, between knowing and daring to speak. In a world where truth is heavy, where saying too much can turn you into a target, I have learned that silence is not always safety. Sometimes, it is just another form of erasure.

                            The Void Petal is a flower born not of earth but of absence—a creation rooted in the unseen corners of the human psyche. Its petals unfold in the vast emptiness we carry, fragile yet unyielding, while its singular eye gazes unflinchingly into the truths we refuse to confront. <br>
                            This flower thrives in the hollows of silence, where restless thoughts fester and buried emotions echo. It does not bloom for beauty or admiration but to remind us of the voids we fill with distraction, the shadows we veil in light. The eye at its center does not judge; it watches, it waits, and it questions. What lies beneath the surface? What remains unspoken, unseen, unresolved?

                            Lagos never stops moving, and neither do we. The city is a constant cycle of change, always shifting and evolving. The Danfo moves forward, and the figure at the back remains undefined because in Lagos, nothing is ever truly still. That figure could be anybody, anyone navigating the chaos, the dreams, the uncertainty. <br>
                            We are all in transit, caught between who we were, who we are, and who we’re yet to become. Change is the only constant, and in this city, we are always becoming.

                            In the depths of our emotions, where the heart beats with both vulnerability and strength, the eyes become storytellers, whispering tales of joy, sorrow, and everything in between. As the words delicately etched on the paper, they give voice to these unspoken feelings, revealing the raw essence of the human experience. Each stroke of my brush is a dance, guided by the symphony of emotions conveyed through the writings. With every brushstroke, I strive to capture the profound meaning behind every gaze, every glance, and every tear that falls.

                            “Tactile Vision” highlights the deep connection between touch and sight, urging us to reconsider how we perceive the world around us. In daily life, we often separate these senses—seeing something from afar, touching it up close—but this artwork challenges that division. The eyes embedded in the palms symbolize how our hands, through touch, can perceive in ways our eyes alone cannot. This reflects the idea that true understanding of the world often comes not just from seeing but from physically engaging with it.

                            “Are men allowed to cry?!” is a thought-provoking artwork that delves into the societal pressures and expectations placed on men when it comes to expressing their emotions. The piece captures the struggle and vulnerability that men may face when they are seen shedding tears. It serves as a powerful commentary on the notion that men are often expected to be strong and stoic, suppressing their emotions in order to conform to traditional gender roles. This artwork aims to create a relatable experience for men, highlighting the importance of breaking free from societal norms and embracing the full range of human emotions. It encourages a more inclusive and empathetic society where men feel comfortable expressing their feelings without judgment or stigma           </div>             <a href="#" class="btn">Buy art</a>
